                    <p>In some circumstances, they might be entitled to a larger grant. There are 3 levels of funding money that can be added to the transfer grant:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>fast track</li>

                <li>£80,000 for secondary and all-through schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some circumstances, the sponsor might be entitled to a larger grant.</p>
            <p>This would be the intermediate grant, or the full sponsored grant.</p>
            <p>Intermediate grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>£90,000 for primary and special schools</li>
                <li>£115,000 for secondary and all-through schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Full sponsored grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>£110,000 for primary and special schools</li>
                <li>£150,000 secondary and all-through schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All grants include the £25,000 conversion support grant. This is used to fund conversion costs, such as legal expenses. Any amount left after conversion costs have been paid for should be used for school improvements.</p>
            <p>A business case must be approved at advisory board, or by the regional director, for a trust to get the intermediate or full sponsored grant.</p>
